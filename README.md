# Dummy Pay

For more information, see [dummypay.io](https://dummypay.io).

## API

I don't feel like writing out the whole thing right now. Checkout [dummypay.io](https://dummypay.io) for more infos and read the source if you want to know everything there is to know.

## Host myself?
Sure! Just install Docker and Docker Compose, adjust the hostname in the `Caddyfile`, and run `docker-compose up -d`.

## TODO
 - emulate existing payment gateways
